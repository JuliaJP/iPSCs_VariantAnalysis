# iPSCs_VariantAnalysis
Methodology for analyzing pathogenic variants within the genome of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells

## Workflow
This workflow follows the core steps involved in calling variants with Broad's Genome Analysis Toolkit, using the "Best Practices" developed by GATK team


## Requirements
-hg38 reference 


-bwa 0.7.17-r1188 


-samtools 1.13 (using htslib 1.13+ds) 


-gatk 


-intervar 


-annovar
